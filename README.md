# StabilityFlagellarLengths

This code is used to calculate trajectories and contours of the Lyapunov function in the (L_1,L_2) phase space, according to the active disassembly model of flagellar length control [Fai et al, Length regulation of multiple flagella that self-assemble from a shared pool of components, \emph{eLife}, 8, (2019): e42599].
